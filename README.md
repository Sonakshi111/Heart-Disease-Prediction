# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project presents a Machine Learning-based model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on key medical parameters.

~ Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive system that leverages supervised learning algorithms to assist in detection of heart disease. By analyzing medical data, the model aims to provide a reliable and interpretable prediction to support healthcare decisions.

~ Models Used
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Tree Classifier
-Random Forest Classifier

Each model was trained and evaluated using standard metrics to determine its effectiveness in classification tasks.
